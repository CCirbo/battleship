Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern.

How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
    We started off by reading it over, and figuring out just HOW to start. James did a great job making a new class lib and spec files and started us down the road with the initial code method and testing.
If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
    Getting through iteration 3, then looking over all the classes and refactoring if needed,
    then trying iteration 4.

Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project. 
    We did a lot of group work time, via zoom and homeroom, we talked everyday in slack and wrote comments in the PR requests. We did a lot of driver/navigator working style

Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project. 
    We again talked every day, either with doing the coding together or updating each other when we did something on our own. We did this via slack and comments on the pull requests. We also left commented out messages in the lib or spec files for further clarification of what we had done.
